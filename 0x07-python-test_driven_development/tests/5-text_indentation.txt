Using ``text_indentation``
---------------------------

This function takes a string and prints it with two new lines after each period, question mark, and colon. Spaces after these punctuation marks are not printed.

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

    >>> text_indentation("Hello? Are you sure. Yes:")
    Hello?
    
    Are you sure.
    
    Yes:

    >>> text_indentation("Check: this out. Is it working? Yes.")
    Check:
    
    this out.
    
    Is it working?
    
    Yes.

    >>> text_indentation("No space after?This should work.")
    No space after?
    
    This should work.

    >>> text_indentation("Single line.")
    Single line.

    >>> text_indentation("Line with space at end. ")
    Line with space at end.

    >>> text_indentation(" ")
    

    >>> text_indentation("")
    

    >>> try:
    ...     text_indentation(100)
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    text must be a string

    >>> try:
    ...     text_indentation(None)
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    text must be a string

Remember to test edge cases such as empty strings, strings with only spaces, and non-string inputs.
